“y” -> this speeds up the rate at which he is getting pelted by rocks

“u” - this slows down the aforementioned rate

“h” - this changes the light color to be random even when flickering

“j” - this changes the light color to its original color of purple

“n” - this changes the light position to a random area around the scene

“m” - this changes the light position to its original location

By left clicking, you are able to throw rocks onto Saitama and watch the collision detection work on him.
